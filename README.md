# git-branch-keeper

A smart Git branch management tool that helps keep your repository clean and organized. It identifies and helps you clean up merged and stale branches while protecting branches with open pull requests.

## Features

- üìä Display branch status in a beautiful table format
- üîç Filter branches by status (merged/stale/all)
- üîÑ Detect merged branches
- ‚è∞ Identify stale branches based on age
- üîí Protect branches with open PRs
- üöÄ Support for both local and remote branch cleanup
- üìù Detailed status reporting
- ‚ö° Force mode for automated cleanup
- üîç Dry-run mode to preview changes

## Understanding Branch Status

When you run `git-branch-keeper`, you'll see a table with these columns:

- **Branch**: The branch name (* indicates current branch)
- **Last Commit**: Date of the most recent commit
- **Age (days)**: Days since the last commit
- **Status**: 
  - `active` - Branch has unmerged changes
  - `merged` - Branch changes are in the main branch (safe to delete)
  - `stale` - Branch is older than the configured stale days
- **Sync**:
  - `synced` - Local and remote are at the same commit
  - `ahead X` - Local is X commits ahead of remote
  - `behind X` - Local is X commits behind remote
  - `diverged` - Local and remote have different commits
  - `local-only` - No remote branch exists
  - `merged-git` - Detected as merged by git
  - `merged-pr` - Merged via GitHub PR
- **Remote**: ‚úì if branch exists on remote, ‚úó if local only
- **PRs**: Number of open pull requests (if GitHub token configured)
- **Notes**: Additional information about the branch

## Installation

### Development Installation

Since this package is currently in development, install it directly from the source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/WeR1Hub/git-branch-keeper.git
cd git-branch-keeper

# Install using uv
uv sync --dev
```

### Future Installation (Once Published)

Once the package is published to PyPI, you'll be able to install it using:

```bash
# Using uv
uv tool install git-branch-keeper
```

## Usage

Basic usage:

```bash
# Show status of all branches
git-branch-keeper --status all

# Show only merged branches
git-branch-keeper --status merged

# Show only stale branches
git-branch-keeper --status stale

# Delete merged branches (interactive)
git-branch-keeper --status merged

# Delete stale branches (interactive)
git-branch-keeper --status stale

# Force delete merged branches (no confirmation)
git-branch-keeper --status merged -f

# Dry run to see what would be deleted
git-branch-keeper --status merged --dry-run
```

## Configuration

The tool can be configured using a JSON configuration file. By default, it looks for:
1. A file specified via command line argument
2. `git-branch-keeper.json` in the current directory
3. `.git-branch-keeper.json` in your home directory

Copy the example configuration file to get started:

```bash
cp git-branch-keeper.example.json git-branch-keeper.json
```

### Configuration Options

```json
{
    "protected_branches": [                        // Branches that will never be modified
        "main",
        "master",
        "dev"
    ],
    "ignore_patterns": [                          // Branch patterns to ignore (glob syntax)
        "develop",                                // Exact match
        "staging",                                // Exact match
        "release/*",                              // All release branches
        "feature/*",                              // All feature branches
        "hotfix/*"                                // All hotfix branches
    ],
    "stale_days": 30,                            // Number of days before a branch is considered stale
    "github_token": "your-github-token-here"      // GitHub personal access token (optional)
}
```

The `protected_branches` list specifies branches that will never be modified or deleted by the tool. By default, this includes "main" and "master". The repository information is automatically detected from your git remote URL.

### GitHub Token Setup

The GitHub token enables the tool to check for open pull requests and detect merged PRs. To set up a token:

1. **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
   - Or navigate: GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)
   - Select these scopes:
     - `repo` - Full control of private repositories
     - `read:org` - Read org and team membership (if working with org repos)
   - Generate the token and copy it

2. **Configure the token** (choose one method):
   
   **Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Set for current session
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token-here"
   
   # Add to shell config for persistence
   echo 'export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-token-here"' >> ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```
   
   **Option B: Configuration File**
   ```json
   {
       "github_token": "your-token-here",
       // ... other config options
   }
   ```
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: If using the config file method, ensure you don't commit the token to version control. Add `git-branch-keeper.json` to your `.gitignore`.

Branch patterns support glob syntax:
- `*` matches any sequence of characters
- `?` matches any single character
- `[seq]` matches any character in seq
- `[!seq]` matches any character not in seq

For example:
- `feature/*` matches all feature branches
- `release/v?.?.*` matches release branches like "release/v1.2.3"
- `hotfix-*` matches all hotfix branches

## Options

- `--status {all,merged,stale}`: Filter branches by status
- `-f, --force`: Force deletion without confirmation
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be deleted without making changes
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose output
- `-c, --config`: Path to config file
- `--stale-days`: Days before a branch is considered stale (default: 30)
- `--version`: Show version information
